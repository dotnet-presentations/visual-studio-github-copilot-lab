This lab will guide you through using GitHub Copilot's various features in Visual Studio 2026. You'll start with a partially completed TinyShop application and use GitHub Copilot to complete missing features and enhance the application.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2026 with GitHub Copilot extension installed
- .NET 10 SDK
- GitHub account with Copilot subscription (including Free)

## Lab Overview

The TinyShop application consists of two main projects:
- A backend API built with .NET Minimal APIs
- A frontend Blazor Server application

You'll use GitHub Copilot's various features to enhance and complete this application.
